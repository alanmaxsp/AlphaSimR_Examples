Description:

Performs a simulation of a maize breeding program to measure the effect of switching from initial evaluation of DH lines on testcross performance to evaluation on per se performance. The simulation models 20 years of burn-in for a breeding using the testcross scheme followed by 20 years of breeding in either the testcross or per se scenarios. The design of the breeding program is based on the breeding program on page 211 of "Essentials of Plant Breeding". The rationale for this comparison is based on a recommendation of Troyer and Wellin (2009). The number of QTL and the values for dominance degree have been chosen to approximately match the long-term rates of genetic gain shown in figure 2 of Troyer and Wellin (2009).

To run this simulation, run the RUNME.R script. Assuming all other scripts are in your working directly, this script will automatically call all necessary scripts. The script will save the results to files called "Scenario1.rds" and "Scenario2.rds". Plots for the results can be created using code in the ANALYZERESULTS.R script.
